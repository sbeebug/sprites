    <h1>Gem Hunter</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Goal: Find the hidden gemstones</strong></p>
    
    <p>In my game, you play as an explorer who discovers a secret cave. 
    You must navigate through different passageways within the cave. Equipted with a coin and a lighter,
    the player makes choices on where to go and looks to find clues. Each clue will lead to the next clue
    and weave the player through tunnels. Leave it up to chance and flip a coin, or use your lighter to look closely 
    at different areas. The player wins when they find the hidden gemstone at the end of the tunnels. </p>
